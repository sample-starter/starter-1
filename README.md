### How to Use the Template

1. **Copy the Template**: Copy the content above into a `README.md` file in the root directory of your Spring Boot project.

2. **Update Placeholder Texts**: Replace placeholder texts like `your_database`, `your_username`, and `your_password` with actual values relevant to your project.

3. **Add Specific Instructions**: If there are specific setup steps or dependencies unique to your project, include those details.

4. **Maintain the README**: Keep the `README.md` file updated as the project evolves. This helps maintainers and contributors understand the project structure and setup easily.

This `README.md` template provides a comprehensive guide for setting up and running a Spring Boot application, making it easier for developers to get started with the project.
